### Learning Challenge by Becode

## **Who did this project ?**

Me, Dana√©, based on a Becode assignment.

## **Why create this projet ?**

It's a BeCode project to train our HTML, CSS and GITHUB.

## **What language are used?**

HTML and CSS.

## **What the easiest part ?**

The semantic in HTML.

## **What the hardest part ?**

The horrendous design ! No, I'm joking, it's a good way to learn :) The real hard part was to figure out the margin of the <q> tag, it took me some time and help from my teammates to realise that I needed to change its display.
